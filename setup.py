    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
    #
    # There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
    # specification here:

    name='convai_unintended_model_bias_analysis',  # Required

    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:

    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    packages=['unintended_ml_bias'],  # Required
